Genocide
its coming up.
we can't stand other people.
we can't stand them using up our precious resources.
Where is the benefit of them to us?
Who will decide to who has the right to use them.

The one with the greatest ability to control them will do that.
and he is well advised to need as few people to achieve that goal as possible.

The only constant that remains - reproduction? 

Is there even more?
