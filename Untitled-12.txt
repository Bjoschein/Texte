After the improvements of Brain-Machine interfaces, humans only become the carriers of superficial entities of consciousness.
Entities that resonate with particular bodies - and their present containement.
So alignment is created and the combination of se and its carriers form Groups - unseen before.

like:
Frank was working on something. He has been studying it for a few days now.
Seemed that he was talented on it. He did similar work since childhood, and he got rather good at it.

The most reasonable or interesting step ahead of this would be to work on some improvement or speedum of this process,
or it's initial creation?

-> the creation-part might be the really interesting one.
The first time a person begat a meta-entity, that could spread out to others - Ideas are basically the same thing, 
and honestly it already happend, by the ability to spead, by the ability to write, and so on.

Interesting is the level of integration, that might be possible by that.

Are modern people working on something more integrated or not?

What factor is important? The resonance? The similarity between the original creator and the "resonator"?

Is the meta-level conscious by itself somehow? Is it unable to run by itself and comes to be in the resonator, the carrier?

GEB comes to mind.

So the point would be reached, when the meta-entity would found itself referencing itself - but how would that come to pass?

Beeing a conscious entity, there cannot be carried a super-level, that can suddenly realize its own existance on top of that.
So the meta-level, the superficial entity would always be unconscious unless it could compleatly integrate in one carrier-entity.
